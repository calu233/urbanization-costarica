# Urbanization in Costa Rica

Defining space we have occupied from wildlife in Costa Rica.

# Introduction 

For my project, I decided to look at area taken up by human population in Costa Rica. Costa Rica is a location known for it's abundant wildlife, beautiful beaches, and amazing rainforests. Tourism is high in the area for all of those reasons. However, much of the rainforest is now becoming urbanized due to population growth and catering to tourists. There is an overwhelming amound of habitat fragmentation causing problems for wildlife. If you want to learn more about urbanization for wildlife, specifically two and three-fingered sloths, please go to the Sloth Conservation Foundation website linked below.

# Data Source 

I downloaded data from Texas A&M University's online library. There were several different maps about Costa Rica on website. I used maps that showed the water areas, water lines, land coverage, population, as well as OpenStreetMap. The projection of the original data was EPSG 4326-WGS 84.

# Map Making Process

Start with adding OpenStreetMap into QGIS. I zoomed into focus on Costa Rica but you can also use the coordinates -9355433, 1109152 that are for San Jose.

After downloading my base maps to my folder in documents, I added each one to my map. For the water lines and water area data, I went to Layers-> Add Vector Layer.

Below you can see the Water Lines and Water Area basemaps added to the map.

For the land cover and poplation data, I went to Layers-> Add Raster Layer.
